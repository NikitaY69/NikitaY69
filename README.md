# Hello world ^_^
- 👋 Hi, I’m Nikita. I was studying physics in Canada as an international student and I'm currently taking a gap year because of the pandemic. I will complete my degree in Paris-Saclay University in 2023.
- 👀 I’m a theoretical and computational physics enthusiast. I thus have some projects in [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/nikita69).
- 🌱 I have strong skills in <ins>Python</ins> and **data analysis**. I’m currently learning <ins>HTML</ins>, <ins>CSS</ins> and <ins>JavaScript</ins>.
- 💞️ Because I have a lot of free time, I plan to build some blogs/websites dealing with academical or even literary topics.
